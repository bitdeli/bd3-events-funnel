This insight lets you define any sequence of events and immediately
see the conversion rate over each step. All users and historical data
are taken into account in the results.

You can examine and compare conversion rates for different types of
users by selecting user segments created from other insights.
Segments can also be created from the funnel by clicking on the
steps in the chart. The resulting segment will contain all users that
have reached that particular point in the sequence of events.
