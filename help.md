This insight lets you define any sequence of events and immediately
see the conversion rate over each step. All users and historical data
are taken into account in the results.

Define the event sequence by writing the event names in the text
field below. Pressing the down arrow shows a list of all event names
in the source data. Individual events can be removed from the
sequence by clicking the "Ã—" icon next to event names or by pressing
backspace in the text field.

You can examine and compare conversion rates for different types of
users by selecting user segments created from other insights.
Segments can also be created from the funnel by clicking on the
steps in the chart. The resulting segment will contain all users that
have reached that particular point in the sequence of events.

**Example:** Enter 2-3 event names corresponding to a typical page
flow or sequence of actions (e.g. "Viewed landing page -> "Viewed
signup form" -> "Submitted signup form"). Click on the last step to
extract a segment of users that have completed the funnel and see
their distinctive properties with
[Characterize](/explore/bitdeli/characterize).
